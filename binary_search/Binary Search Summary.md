# Binary Search Summary

## Principal of Binary Search
1. We must guarantee that search space decreases over time (after each iteration).
2. We must guarantee that the target (if exist) cannot be ruled out accidentally, when we change the value of the Left or Right. (it is critiacl to define the rule about how to move the range for search, 注意要点,反逻辑)
